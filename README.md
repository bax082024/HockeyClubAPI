### Hockey Club Administration API

## Introduction
- My first attempt at making a API with user classes, will be a long project. Bu the intent is to collect all documentation and paperwork etc from the hockey club and collect them in a database, and distribute information based on the users access. examples : training schedules, registration of players and trainers etc, upcoming events, instructions and much more

user access examples: - Admin - access to everything 
                      - Leader - access to systems
                      - Office - access to office documents
                      - Trainer - access to trainer related info
                      - Helper - access to helper related info
