### Hockey Club Administration API

## Introduction
- My first attempt at making a API with user classes, will be a long project. Bu the intent is to collect all documentation and paperwork etc from the hockey club and collect them in a database, and distribute information based on the users access. examples : training schedules, registration of players and trainers etc, upcoming events, instructions and much more

user access examples: - Admin
                      - Leader
                      - Office
                      - Trainer
                      - Helper
